# Roman-Calculator-Project-CECS7-174-
For this project, we were tasked to create a program that would perform specific arithmetic operations using Arabic and Roman numeral representation. To provide a seamless user experience, we output a menu interface to the user and prompt them to enter a valid roman numeral following subtractive notation and ask them to select from one of 4 operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The program will then continue asking the user if they would like to run the code again until they choose to exit out of it.
